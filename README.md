# tictactoe
This is a site that lets you and another user play tictactoe

## Installation Steps
1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Type `cd tictactoe` to move into the root directory.
3. Start the site by typing `open index.html` in your terminal.

## Instructions
Simply click on the spot you want to take, you cannot take a space that the other player has already taken, the top text will tell you whose turn it is. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row is the winner!

## Challenges
The biggest challenge during this project was deleting 90% of my work, I had to rebuild my entire project in a day and a half. My second biggest challenge was figuring out how to set the win conditions so that they would work everytime.

## Future Features
I'd really like my X and O markers to be images or animated gifs or allow the players to choose their own image/symbol to use. I'd also like to to make my comp look at lot better than it does but I simply ran out of time.
